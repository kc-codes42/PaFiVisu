# PaFiVisu

A modern, web-based pathfinding algorithm visualizer built with Vanilla JavaScript and Tailwind CSS.

## üöÄ Features
- **Interactive 2D Grid**: Click to add/remove walls, set start/end nodes.
- **Algorithm Visualizations**: Supports Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search, Dijkstra, and A* (Manhattan heuristic).
- **Step-by-Step Animation**: Watch nodes being visited and the shortest path being found in real time.
- **Speed Control**: Adjust animation speed with a slider ("Fast" to "Slow").
- **Random Maze Generation**: Instantly create a random maze.
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Toggle between pastel light and dark themes.
- **Responsive UI**: Works on desktop and mobile screens.
- **Clean, Modern Design**: Built with Tailwind CSS and a pastel color palette.
- **Creator Tag**: "Built by kc.codes" always visible in the corner.

## üõ† Tech Stack
